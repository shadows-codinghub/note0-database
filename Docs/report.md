<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
</center>
<p>The Note0 project is a desktop-based note-sharing application developed in Java using the Swing framework. It provides a platform for users to register, log in, and share educational materials. The application follows a client-server architecture, with the Java Swing application acting as the client and a PostgreSQL database as the server. Key features include secure user authentication with password hashing, a role-based access control system (distinguishing between regular users and administrators), and a feed for browsing and managing shared materials. The application also integrates with the Cloudinary service for cloud-based file storage, allowing users to upload and share files seamlessly. The user interface is designed with FlatLaf for a modern look and feel, and the backend is supported by a robust database schema with features like material approval status. The project is built and managed using Apache Maven.</p>

<h1>Chapter 1: Introduction</h1>
</center>

<h2>1.1 Project Overview</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">The Note0 project is a desktop-based note-sharing application designed for students and educators. It provides a simple and efficient platform for sharing and accessing educational materials. Built using Java Swing for the frontend and backed by a PostgreSQL database, the application offers a robust and scalable solution for academic collaboration. The project emphasizes security, usability, and a modern user experience through the integration of various third-party libraries.</p>

<h2>1.2 Problem Statement</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">In many educational institutions, the process of sharing and accessing study materials is often fragmented and inefficient. Students and teachers rely on a variety of platforms, such as email, social media, and physical copies, which can lead to disorganization and difficulty in finding relevant materials. The Note0 project aims to solve this problem by providing a centralized and dedicated platform for academic note sharing.</p>

<h2>1.3 Scope of the Project</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">The scope of this project is to develop a desktop application with the following key functionalities:
<ul>
    <li>User registration and login</li>
    <li>Secure password storage</li>
    <li>Role-based access control (USER and ADMIN roles)</li>
    <li>Uploading and viewing of educational materials</li>
    <li>An administrative panel for user and content management</li>
</ul>
The project is designed to be a proof-of-concept for a more extensive note-sharing platform.</p>

<h2>1.4 Project Goals and Objectives</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">The primary goal of the Note0 project is to create a centralized platform for note sharing. The key objectives are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To develop a secure user authentication system.</li>
    <li>To enable users to upload, view, and manage educational materials.</li>
    <li>To provide an administrative interface for user and content management.</li>
    <li>To ensure data integrity and security through proper database design and security practices.</li>
    <li>To deliver a modern and intuitive user interface.</li>
</ul>

<br><br><br>

<h1>Chapter 2: System Architecture</h1>
</center>

<h2>2.1 High-Level Architecture</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">The application follows a two-tier client-server architecture. The Java Swing application serves as the client, providing the user interface and business logic. The PostgreSQL database acts as the server, storing all application data. The application also interacts with the external Cloudinary service for file storage.</p>

<h2>2.2 Two-Tier Architecture</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">In this two-tier model:
<ul>
    <li><b>Client-Tier:</b> The Java Swing application is the client. It is responsible for presenting the user interface and handling user interactions. It communicates directly with the database to retrieve and store data.</li>
    <li><b>Data-Tier:</b> The PostgreSQL database is the data tier. It stores all the application data, including user information, materials, and subjects. The database is responsible for data persistence and integrity.</li>
</ul>
This architecture is simple to implement and is well-suited for a small to medium-sized application like Note0.</p>

<h2>2.3 Component Diagram</h2>

<h1>Chapter 3: Component Analysis</h1>
</center>

<h2>3.1 UI Components</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">The user interface is built using Java Swing and is organized into several panels, each responsible for a specific functionality:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>MainFrame:</b> The main window of the application that holds all other UI components. It manages the card layout to switch between different panels.</li>
    <li><b>WelcomeForm:</b> The initial screen that provides options to navigate to the Login or Registration panels.</li>
    <li><b>LoginPanel:</b> Provides the user interface for logging in. It contains text fields for email and password, a login button, and a link to the registration panel.</li>
    <li><b>RegistrationPanel:</b> Provides the user interface for new user registration. It includes fields for full name, email, password, college, and semester.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;"><b>Figure 4: Login Screen Screenshot</b></p>
<center>
<img src="[PLACEHOLDER_FOR_LOGIN_SCREEN_SCREENSHOT]" alt="Login Screen Screenshot">

<ul>
    <li><b>DashboardPanel:</b> The main user dashboard after login. It contains a sidebar for navigation and a main content area to display different panels like Feed, Profile, and Admin.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;"><b>Figure 5: Dashboard Screenshot</b></p>
<center>
<img src="[PLACEHOLDER_FOR_DASHBOARD_SCREENSHOT]" alt="Dashboard Screenshot">
</center>
<ul>
    <li><b>FeedPanel:</b> Displays a scrollable feed of study materials. Each material is displayed with its title, description, uploader, and subject. It also includes an "Upload" button to add new materials.</li>
    <li><b>ProfilePanel:</b> Shows the profile information of the logged-in user.</li>
    <li><b>AdminPanel:</b> A special panel visible only to admin users. It allows admins to view a list of all users and approve or reject uploaded materials.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;"><b>Figure 6: Admin Panel Screenshot</b></p>
<center>
<img src="[PLACEHOLDER_FOR_ADMIN_PANEL_SCREENSHOT]" alt="Admin Panel Screenshot">
</center>


<h2>3.2 Data Access Objects (DAOs)</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">Data persistence is managed by a set of Data Access Objects (DAOs):</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>UserDAO:</b> Handles all database operations related to users, such as creating, retrieving, and updating user information. It includes methods for user registration, login with password verification (using jBCrypt), and fetching all users for the admin panel.</li>
    <li><b>SubjectDAO:</b> Manages the subjects available in the application. It has methods to get all subjects from the database.</li>
    <li><b>MaterialDAO:</b> Responsible for database operations related to materials, including creation, retrieval, and updates. It fetches all materials for the feed and allows for material approval by admins.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3.3 Services</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">The application uses a service for interacting with the Cloudinary API:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>CloudinaryService:</b> Provides methods for uploading files to the Cloudinary cloud storage. It handles the connection to the Cloudinary API and manages the file upload process, returning the URL of the uploaded file.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Chapter 5: File-by-File Analysis</h1>
</center>

<h2>5.1 com.note0.simple.Main</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">This is the entry point of the application. Its `main` method uses `SwingUtilities.invokeLater` to ensure that the GUI is created on the Event Dispatch Thread (EDT), which is essential for a stable Swing application. It first creates an instance of `UserDAO` to ensure the admin user exists, and then it creates and displays the `MainFrame`.</p>

<h2>5.2 com.note0.simple.MainFrame</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">This class extends `JFrame` and serves as the main window of the application. It uses a `CardLayout` to manage and switch between different panels. It holds a reference to the currently logged-in user and provides methods to show different panels like the welcome screen, login, registration, and dashboard.</p>

<h2>5.3 com.note0.simple.WelcomeForm</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">This panel is the initial screen that users see. It presents two buttons: "Login" and "Register". Action listeners on these buttons call methods in `MainFrame` to switch to the `LoginPanel` or `RegistrationPanel` respectively.</p>

<h2>5.4 com.note0.simple.LoginForm & com.note0.simple.LoginPanel</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">The `LoginPanel` provides the GUI for the login form, including fields for email and password, a "Login" button, and a link to the registration panel. When the login button is clicked, it retrieves the email and password, and calls the `loginUser` method of the `UserDAO`. If the login is successful, the `MainFrame` is notified to switch to the `DashboardPanel`.</p>

<h2>5.5 com.note0.simple.RegistrationForm & com.note0.simple.RegistrationPanel</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">The `RegistrationPanel` provides the form for new users to register. It includes fields for full name, email, password, college, and semester. Upon clicking the "Register" button, the input is validated, a new `User` object is created, and the `registerUser` method of the `UserDAO` is called to save the new user to the database.</p>

<h2>5.6 com.note0.simple.DashboardPanel</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">This panel serves as the main dashboard for logged-in users. It has a sidebar with navigation buttons for "Feed", "Profile", and "Logout". If the user is an admin, an "Admin" button is also displayed. The main content area of the dashboard uses a `CardLayout` to display the `FeedPanel`, `ProfilePanel`, or `AdminPanel` based on the user's selection.</p>

<h2>5.7 com.note0.simple.FeedPanel</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">The `FeedPanel` is responsible for displaying the list of shared materials. It fetches all approved materials from the database using the `MaterialDAO` and displays them in a `JScrollPane`. Each material is displayed in a separate panel that shows the title, description, uploader, and subject. An "Upload" button allows users to open a file chooser and upload a new material.</p>

<h2>5.8 com.note0.simple.ProfilePanel</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">This panel displays the information of the currently logged-in user, including their name, email, college, and semester. The data is retrieved from the `User` object stored in the `MainFrame`.</p>

<h2>5.9 com.note0.simple.AdminPanel & com.note0.simple.AdminForm</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">These components are exclusively for admin users. The `AdminPanel` shows two tabs: one for managing users and another for approving materials. The user management tab displays a list of all registered users. The material approval tab shows a list of materials with a "PENDING" status. The admin can then choose to "Approve" or "Reject" each material.</p>

<h2>5.10 com.note0.simple.DatabaseManager</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">This class manages the connection to the PostgreSQL database. It reads the database URL, username, and password from environment variables and uses the `DriverManager` to establish a connection. It provides a static `getConnection` method that is used by all the DAO classes.</p>

<h2>5.11 com.note0.simple.UserDAO</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">The `UserDAO` handles all database operations related to users. Key methods include:
- `registerUser(User user)`: Inserts a new user into the database, hashing the password with `jBCrypt`.
- `loginUser(String email, String password)`: Retrieves a user by email and verifies the password using `jBCrypt`.
- `createAdminUser()`: Creates a default admin user if one does not already exist.
- `getAllUsers()`: Fetches a list of all users for the admin panel.</p>

<h2>5.12 com.note0.simple.MaterialDAO</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">This DAO is responsible for all database operations related to materials. Its main methods are:
- `uploadMaterial(Material material)`: Inserts a new material record into the database.
- `getAllApprovedMaterials()`: Retrieves all materials that have been approved by an admin.
- `getPendingMaterials()`: Fetches all materials with a "PENDING" status for the admin panel.
- `updateMaterialStatus(int materialId, String status)`: Updates the approval status of a material.</p>

<h2>5.13 com.note0.simple.SubjectDAO</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">The `SubjectDAO` manages the subjects in the database. It has a `getAllSubjects()` method that retrieves all available subjects, which are used to populate a dropdown menu in the material upload form.</p>

<h2>5.14 com.note0.simple.CloudinaryService</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">This service class encapsulates the logic for interacting with the Cloudinary API. It is configured with the cloud name, API key, and API secret from environment variables. The `uploadFile(String filePath)` method takes a local file path, uploads the file to Cloudinary, and returns the public URL of the uploaded file.</p>

<h2>5.15 Data Models (User, Subject, Material)</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">These are plain old Java objects (POJOs) that represent the data structures of the application. They have fields that correspond to the columns in the database tables and are used to pass data between the different layers of the application (e.g., from the UI to the DAOs).</p>


<br><br><br>
<center>
<h1>Chapter 6: Key Features</h1>
</center>

<h2>6.1 User Authentication</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">The application implements a secure user authentication system. New users can register by providing their details, and their passwords are automatically hashed using the jBCrypt library before being stored in the database. Existing users can log in with their email and password, and the application verifies their credentials against the stored hashed password.</p>

<h2>6.2 Material Sharing</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">Once logged in, users can share educational materials. The application allows users to upload files, which are then stored in the Cloudinary cloud storage. The metadata of the uploaded material, such as the title, description, and subject, is stored in the PostgreSQL database. Users can view a feed of shared materials and access the uploaded files.</p>

<h2>6.3 Admin Panel</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">The application includes a dedicated admin panel for administrative tasks. The admin panel is accessible only to users with the \'ADMIN\' role. It provides functionalities for managing users, such as viewing all registered users and approving new materials.</p>

<br><br><br>

<center>
<h1>Chapter 7: Security Analysis</h1>
</center>

<h2>7.1 Password Hashing</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">To enhance security, the application does not store passwords in plain text. Instead, it uses the jBCrypt library to hash passwords before storing them in the database. When a user attempts to log in, the provided password is hashed and then compared with the stored hash, preventing unauthorized access even if the database is compromised.</p>

<h2>7.2 Role-Based Access Control</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">The application implements a role-based access control (RBAC) system to manage user permissions. There are two roles: \'USER\' and \'ADMIN\'. Regular users have access to the standard features of the application, such as sharing and viewing materials. Administrators have elevated privileges, including access to the admin panel for user and content management.</p>

<br><br><br>

<center>
<h1>Chapter 8: Dependencies</h1>
</center>

<h2>8.1 Maven Dependencies</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">The project uses Apache Maven for dependency management. The key dependencies are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>postgresql:</b> The JDBC driver for connecting to a PostgreSQL database.</li>
    <li><b>jbcrypt:</b> A library for securely hashing and checking passwords.</li>
