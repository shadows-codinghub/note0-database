\chapter*{Abstract}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}

Access to organized and sufficient study material is a cornerstone of effective education. However, students often face challenges due to the limited availability of physical textbooks and the fragmented nature of digital notes. This project, titled "note0," addresses this issue by developing a centralized and collaborative desktop application for note-sharing.

The system is built using a 3-tier architecture. The client-side user interface is developed with the Java Swing framework, providing a responsive and intuitive desktop experience. The server-side business logic is handled by a robust Java backend. All data, including user credentials and note content, is securely stored in a cloud-hosted PostgreSQL database, ensuring data persistence and accessibility. The project is managed using Apache Maven, which standardizes the build process and handles dependency management.

Key features of note0 include secure user authentication, comprehensive note management (Create, Read, Update, Delete), collaborative note-sharing capabilities, and a powerful search function. The platform successfully provides a solution to the initial problem by creating a unified hub where students can pool their collective knowledge, ensuring that essential study materials are accessible to everyone in the learning community. This report details the design, architecture, implementation, and testing of the note0 application.

\section{Problem Statement}
Students face two persistent challenges in their academic environment:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Limited Access to Materials:} There is often a significant gap in the availability of essential learning materials and prescribed textbooks, creating a barrier to effective study.
    \item \textbf{Fragmented Information:} Key study notes and digital resources are typically scattered across various personal platforms, making them difficult to find, organize, and share.
\end{itemize}
This environment hinders collaborative learning and creates inefficiencies for students. Our project addresses this need by providing a unified platform to consolidate and distribute essential academic resources.

\section{Project Objectives}
The primary objective of this project is to design and develop a desktop application that serves as a centralized repository for academic notes. The specific goals are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To develop a secure system for user registration and login.
    \item To provide functionalities for creating, editing, viewing, and deleting notes.
    \item To implement a feature that allows users to securely share their notes with other registered users.
    \item To ensure data is stored persistently and accessibly using a cloud-based PostgreSQL database.
    \item To build a user-friendly and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).
\end{itemize}

\section{Scope and Limitations}
The scope of this project is to deliver a fully functional desktop application with the core features mentioned above. The application is intended for students within an academic institution. 

Limitations include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The current version is a desktop application and does not have a web or mobile client.
    \item Real-time collaborative editing (like Google Docs) is not supported in this version.
    \item The application requires an active internet connection to synchronize with the cloud PostgreSQL database.
\end{itemize}
%======================================================================
%   DETAILED SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS SECTION
%   Replace the existing section in Chapter 1 with this code.
%======================================================================

{Scope and Limitations}

The scope of the note0 project is to deliver a robust and fully functional desktop application designed to serve as a centralized platform for academic note-sharing. The system's primary boundary encompasses the complete lifecycle of note management, which includes providing users with the ability to \textbf{Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)} notes through an intuitive Java Swing interface. A core feature within the project's scope is the implementation of a secure \textbf{user authentication} system, ensuring that all user data and notes are protected. Furthermore, the scope includes a \textbf{collaborative sharing} mechanism, allowing a registered user to grant access to their notes to other specific users on the platform. The technical scope involves a complete 3-tier architecture, with persistent data storage handled by a cloud-hosted \textbf{PostgreSQL database} and project dependencies managed by \textbf{Maven}.

It is important to acknowledge the limitations of the current version of the application to understand its boundaries clearly. The most significant limitation is that note0 is exclusively a \textbf{desktop application}, meaning it lacks a web-based or mobile client. This restricts access to users who are on a machine with the required Java Runtime Environment and the application installed. While the platform supports note sharing, it does not facilitate \textbf{real-time collaborative editing}; multiple users cannot edit the same note simultaneously. Additionally, the application is designed to be online-first and requires a persistent \textbf{internet connection} to synchronize with the cloud PostgreSQL database, as there is no offline functionality for creating or viewing notes. Finally, advanced features common in commercial products, such as folder-based organization, version history, or support for rich media attachments, are outside the scope of this project version and are identified as potential areas for future development.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\chapter{System Architecture and Design}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{System Architecture}
The note0 application is designed using a 3-tier architecture, which separates the application into logical layers. This separation enhances modularity, scalability, and maintainability. The three tiers are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Presentation Tier (Client):} This is the user interface that the user interacts with. It is developed using the Java Swing framework to create a responsive desktop application. Its primary role is to display data to the user and accept user input.
    \item \textbf{Logic Tier (Backend Server):} This tier contains the core business logic of the application. It is a Java-based server that processes requests from the client, interacts with the database, and enforces application rules. Services like authentication, note management, and sharing logic reside here.
    \item \textbf{Data Tier (Database):} This tier is responsible for data storage and retrieval. We have used a PostgreSQL relational database hosted on a cloud platform (Aiven). This ensures that the data is persistent, secure, and accessible over the internet.
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

%======================================================================
%   DETAILED TECHNOLOGY STACK SECTION
%   Replace the existing list in Chapter 2 with this code.
%======================================================================

\subsection{Java Swing}
The entire graphical user interface (GUI) for the note0 desktop application was built using \textbf{Java Swing}. Swing is a mature and powerful GUI widget toolkit for Java that provides a rich set of components for creating interactive and platform-independent desktop applications. It was chosen for this project due to its comprehensive library of components—such as \texttt{JFrame}, \texttt{JPanel}, \texttt{JTable}, and \texttt{JButton}—which allowed for the creation of all the necessary views, from the initial login and registration forms to the complex, data-driven dashboard. Swing's event-driven model was used to handle user interactions, such as button clicks and table selections, to trigger application logic.

\subsection{PostgreSQL (Cloud Hosted)}
For the data persistence layer, we selected \textbf{PostgreSQL}, a powerful, open-source object-relational database system renowned for its reliability, feature robustness, and data integrity. All application data—including user credentials, subject information, material metadata, and user ratings—is stored in a PostgreSQL database hosted on the Aiven cloud platform. This choice was deliberate; using a relational database ensures that the relationships between users, materials, and subjects are strictly maintained. The database schema is designed to be normalized to reduce redundancy. All interactions between the Java application and the database are handled via the standard PostgreSQL JDBC driver, which is specified as a dependency in our project's \texttt{pom.xml} file.

\subsection{Apache Maven}
\textbf{Apache Maven} is the build automation and project management tool used to structure and manage the entire lifecycle of the note0 project. Its primary role in this project is twofold. First, it handles \textbf{dependency management}. All external libraries required by the application, such as the PostgreSQL JDBC driver, the jBCrypt library for password hashing, and the Cloudinary SDK, are declared in the \texttt{pom.xml} file. Maven automatically downloads the correct versions of these libraries and makes them available to the project, which greatly simplifies the setup process. Second, Maven provides a standardized \textbf{build lifecycle}, automating tasks such as compiling the Java source code, managing resources, and executing the application. This ensures that the project is built in a consistent and repeatable manner across different development environments.
\section{Cloud Platform Integration}
To ensure scalability, reliability, and efficient data management, the note0 application leverages a strategic cloud-based infrastructure. Instead of relying on a single service, our architecture separates the hosting of the database from the management of digital content, using specialized platforms for each task. This approach ensures optimal performance and security for different types of data.

\subsection{Database Hosting}
The core PostgreSQL database is hosted on a dedicated Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platform, specifically Aiven. Storing the database in the cloud rather than on a traditional server offers several significant advantages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{High Availability and Reliability:} Cloud database services provide built-in redundancy and failover mechanisms, ensuring the database is almost always online and accessible.
    \item \textbf{Automated Backups:} The platform automatically handles regular backups of the database, which is critical for disaster recovery and preventing data loss.
    \item \textbf{Scalability:} If the application gains more users, the database resources (CPU, RAM, Storage) can be easily scaled up with minimal downtime.
    \item \textbf{Managed Security:} The cloud provider manages underlying security, patching, and network configuration, allowing our team to focus on application-level security.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Digital Asset Management: Cloudinary}
For handling application "contents" such as user-uploaded images or attachments to notes, we have integrated **Cloudinary**. Cloudinary is a specialized cloud platform for managing media assets. Using a dedicated service like Cloudinary instead of storing files directly on our server provides powerful benefits:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Optimized Storage and Delivery:} Cloudinary stores assets on a highly efficient infrastructure and delivers them through a Content Delivery Network (CDN), meaning images load much faster for users anywhere in the world.
    \item \textbf{On-the-Fly Transformations:} It can automatically resize, crop, format, and apply effects to images via simple URL parameters. This removes the need for complex image processing logic in our Java backend.
    \- \textbf{Reduced Server Load:} By offloading the storage and serving of media files, Cloudinary significantly reduces the bandwidth and processing load on our primary application server, keeping it fast and responsive.
\end{itemize}
This dual-platform cloud strategy ensures that our application is robust, performant, and ready to scale as new features and users are added. hosting.
\end{itemize}

\section{Database Schema}
The database is designed to be simple yet effective, with three primary tables.

% \begin{figure}[h!]
%     \centering
%     % You need to create an image file named 'er_diagram.png' and upload it to Overleaf
%     \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/entity_diagram.jpeg}
%     \caption{Entity-Relationship Diagram}
%     \label{fig:entity_diagram}
% \end{figure}

The main tables are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Users:} Stores user information, including a unique user ID, username, and a hashed password for security.
    \item \textbf{Notes:} Stores the content of each note, including a unique note ID, title, content, creation/modification timestamps, and the owner's user ID.
   \item \textbf{ratings:} A mapping table that stores each individual rating. It links a \texttt{user\_id} and a \texttt{material\_id} with a given score, creating a many-to-many relationship between users and materials.

\chapter{Implementation and Testing}
The development of the note0 application was carried out in a modular fashion to ensure a clean separation of concerns and to facilitate maintainability. This chapter details the implementation of the key functional modules of the system. It also provides a comprehensive overview of the testing methodologies used to ensure the application's correctness, reliability, and performance.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Module Implementation}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------
The application is logically divided into several modules, each responsible for a distinct set of functionalities. The implementation of these modules leverages the DAO (Data Access Object) pattern to isolate business logic from data persistence logic.

\subsection{User Authentication Module}
The User Authentication module is the security foundation of the note0 application, responsible for managing user identity and access control. It consists of two primary user-facing components—Registration and Login—supported by a robust backend Data Access Object.

\subsubsection{User Registration}
The registration process is handled by the \texttt{RegistrationPanel.java} class. This UI component provides fields for a user's full name, email, and password. Upon submission, the user's details, along with a securely hashed password using \textbf{jBCrypt}, are inserted into the \texttt{users} table in the PostgreSQL database.

\subsubsection{User Login}
The login process is managed by \texttt{LoginPanel.java}. When a user enters their credentials, the system queries the database for the user and uses \textbf{BCrypt.checkpw()} to securely compare the provided password against the stored hash. If valid, the \texttt{MainFrame} transitions the view to the main dashboard.

\subsection{Note Management and Sharing Module}
In this application, sharing is achieved by uploading a material to the central platform, making it accessible to all users. This module is primarily managed by \texttt{DashboardPanel.java} and \texttt{MaterialDAO.java}.

\subsubsection{Material Upload (Sharing)}
The process of sharing a new material involves the user providing metadata and a file, which is then uploaded to Cloudinary. The secure URL returned by Cloudinary is stored in the \texttt{materials} database table along with the metadata.

\subsubsection{Material Viewing, Rating, and Deletion}
Once uploaded, materials are managed through the dashboard. Users can view materials, which are dynamically loaded and filtered by the \texttt{MaterialDAO}. They can also rate and delete materials, with all actions handled through database transactions to ensure data integrity.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Results and Screenshots}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------
The application successfully meets all the functional requirements outlined in the project objectives. The final system provides a stable and responsive desktop experience for sharing and managing academic materials. The user interface is intuitive, and the integration with cloud services for database and file storage ensures scalability and reliability.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Testing Strategy}
A multi-layered testing strategy was employed to ensure the quality and correctness of the application. This strategy included unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.

\subsubsection{Unit Testing}
Unit tests were designed to verify the functionality of individual methods in isolation, particularly within the Data Access Object (DAO) classes.

\subsubsection{Integration Testing}
Integration testing focused on verifying the interaction between different layers of the application, from a UI event (like a button click) to the database response.

\subsubsection{User Acceptance Testing (UAT)}
UAT was performed manually to ensure the application meets the end-user's requirements and is free of major usability issues.

\section{Conclusion}
We successfully achieved our primary goal of developing **note0**, a collaborative note-sharing platform that directly addresses the challenges of resource scarcity and fragmented information.

The project successfully integrated Java, Swing, and a cloud-hosted PostgreSQL database to create a robust and scalable solution. Maven was instrumental in managing our project's dependencies and build cycle, ensuring a smooth and standardized development process.

In conclusion, **note0** is not just a functional application; it is a proof-of-concept for how technology can bridge gaps in educational resources and foster a more collaborative learning environment.

\section{Future Scope}
The note0 application currently serves as a robust proof-of-concept and a functional platform for sharing academic materials. The existing architecture provides a solid foundation upon which a wide range of advanced features can be built. The following enhancements are identified as a roadmap for the future development of the project.

\subsection{Cross-Platform Accessibility}
The most significant enhancement would be to evolve note0 from a desktop-only application into a full-fledged cross-platform service.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Web Application:} Developing a web-based client using a modern framework (like React or Angular) would make the platform accessible from any device with a web browser, removing the need for a local installation.
    \item \textbf{Mobile Applications:} Creating native mobile applications for Android and iOS would provide users with on-the-go access to their materials, a critical feature for students.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Advanced Collaboration Features}
To transform the application from a simple sharing platform into a truly collaborative tool, the following features could be implemented:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Real-Time Editing:} By integrating technologies like WebSockets, the platform could be enhanced to support simultaneous editing of a single document by multiple users, similar to the functionality of Google Docs.
    \item \textbf{Commenting and Annotation:} Allowing users to leave comments and annotations on specific parts of a document would greatly improve collaborative feedback and discussion.
    \item \textbf{Version History:} Implementing a system to track changes and allow users to revert to previous versions of a note would prevent accidental data loss and provide a clear history of contributions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Enhanced User Experience and Organization}
Improving the user's ability to manage and find their content is crucial for long-term usability.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Folder and Tagging System:} Instead of a single list of materials, users could organize their notes into folders and sub-folders. A tagging system would also allow for more flexible, non-hierarchical organization.
    \item \textbf{Advanced Search:} The current search functionality could be expanded to include full-text search within documents, as well as filtering by date, uploader, rating, and other metadata.
    \item \textbf{Notifications:} A notification system could alert users when a new material is uploaded in a subject they follow, or when another user comments on or rates their contribution.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Offline Functionality}
To improve accessibility, offline support could be implemented. This would involve creating a local cache or database (e.g., using SQLite) on the user's machine. Users could then view, create, and edit their notes without an active internet connection. All changes would be synchronized with the central cloud PostgreSQL database automatically once the user goes online.

\chapter{Sample Code Snippet: Database Connectivity}

A critical component of the backend is its ability to communicate with the cloud-hosted PostgreSQL database. This is handled by the \texttt{DatabaseManager.java} class, which uses the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API. The following code snippet shows the implementation for establishing this connection.

\begin{verbatim}
package com.note0.simple;

import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class DatabaseManager {

    // --- IMPORTANT: REPLACE THESE WITH YOUR AIVEN CREDENTIALS ---
    private static final String DB_URL = "jdbc:postgresql://pg-1f5358eb-note0.k.aivencloud.com:17737/defaultdb?sslmode=require";
    private static final String USER = "avnadmin";
    private static final String PASSWORD = "AVNS_zjes6XbHRJo9YtEPMuI";
    // -----------------------------------------------------------

    public static Connection getConnection() throws SQLException {
        return DriverManager.getConnection(DB_URL, USER, PASSWORD);
    }
}
\end{verbatim}

%======================================================================

\chapter{Detailed Code Explanation: DashboardPanel.java}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Appendix B: Detailed Code Explanation}

The \texttt{DashboardPanel.java} class is the functional core of the note0 application's user interface. After a user successfully authenticates, this panel is displayed and serves as the primary workspace for all material management and interaction. It is an excellent example of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) principle, where the Swing components act as the 'View', and this class acts as the 'Controller', mediating between the UI and the 'Model' (the DAO classes).

The responsibilities of the \texttt{DashboardPanel} can be broken down into three main areas: UI construction, data management, and event handling.

\section{UI Construction and Layout}
The visual structure of the dashboard is built using a combination of Swing layout managers to create a responsive and organized interface. The main panel uses a \texttt{BorderLayout} to divide the screen into distinct regions.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{NORTH Region:} The top panel, created by the \texttt{createTopPanel()} method, contains a welcome message, a logout button, filters for searching, and, conditionally, an "Admin Panel" button that only appears if the logged-in user has the `ADMIN` role.
    \item \textbf{CENTER Region:} This is the largest area, containing the \texttt{JTable} that displays the list of materials. It is wrapped in a \texttt{JScrollPane} to allow for scrolling when the content exceeds the viewable area.
    \item \textbf{SOUTH Region:} The bottom panel, created by \texttt{createBottomPanel()}, contains the form for uploading new materials, including fields for the title, a subject selector, and buttons for choosing a file and initiating the upload.
\end{itemize}

\section{Data Management and Display}
A key function of the dashboard is to fetch data from the database and present it to the user. This is primarily handled by the \texttt{loadMaterialsIntoTable()} method.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{verbatim}
private void loadMaterialsIntoTable() {
    tableModel.setRowCount(0); // Clear the table first
    try {
        String titleFilter = searchField.getText().trim();
        String branchFilter = ...;
        int semesterFilter = ...;
        String subjectFilter = ...;

        List<Material> materials = materialDAO.getMaterials(
            titleFilter, branchFilter, semesterFilter, subjectFilter);
            
        for (Material material : materials) {
            tableModel.addRow(new Object[]{
                material.getId(), material.getTitle(), 
                material.getSubjectName(), material.getUploaderName(), 
                String.format("%.2f", material.getAverageRating())
            });
        }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(this, "Could not load materials: " 
            + e.getMessage(), "DB Error", JOptionPane.ERROR_MESSAGE);
    }
}
\end{verbatim}
\caption{Method for loading and filtering materials from the database.}
\label{fig:load_materials}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:load_materials}, this method demonstrates a complete data retrieval workflow:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item It begins by clearing any existing data from the table model to ensure a fresh display.
    \item It collects the current values from all filter components (search field, subject dropdown, etc.).
    \item It calls the \texttt{materialDAO.getMaterials(...)} method, passing the filter criteria. The DAO is responsible for dynamically building the appropriate SQL query to fetch the correct subset of data from the PostgreSQL database.
    \item Finally, it iterates through the returned list of \texttt{Material} objects and populates the \texttt{JTable} row by row.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Event Handling: Material Upload}
The process of uploading a new material is an excellent example of how the panel handles a complex user action involving file I/O, cloud services, and database interaction. This logic resides in the \texttt{handleUpload()} method.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{verbatim}
private void handleUpload() {
    if (titleField.getText().isBlank() || selectedFile == null || ...) {
        // Input validation...
        return;
    }
    try {
        // 1. Generate a unique ID for the cloud asset
        String publicId = UUID.randomUUID().toString();

        // 2. Call the Cloudinary service to upload the file
        String url = cloudinaryService.uploadFile(selectedFile, 
            "note0/materials", publicId);
        
        // 3. Get the subject ID from the UI
        String selectedSubjectName = (String) uploadSubjectComboBox.getSelectedItem();
        long subjectId = subjectNameToIdMap.get(selectedSubjectName);
        
        // 4. Call the DAO to save metadata to the database
        materialDAO.addMaterial(titleField.getText(), url, subjectId, 
            loggedInUser.getId());
        
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(this, "Upload successful!", "Success", ...);
        loadMaterialsIntoTable(); // Refresh the table
    } catch (Exception ex) {
        // Error handling...
    }
}
\end{verbatim}
\caption{The event handler for uploading a new material.}
\label{fig:handle_upload}
\end{figure}

The workflow, illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:handle_upload}, is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The method first performs input validation to ensure all required fields are filled and a file has been selected.
    \item A unique identifier is generated for the file to prevent naming conflicts in the cloud storage.
    \item The \texttt{cloudinaryService} is called to handle the actual file upload. This service abstracts away the complexity of interacting with the Cloudinary API.
    \item Upon a successful upload, Cloudinary returns a secure URL for the hosted file. This URL, along with other metadata like the title and subject ID, is then passed to the \texttt{materialDAO} to be saved in the database.
    \item Finally, a success message is shown to the user, and the main table is refreshed to include the newly added material.
\end{enumerate}
